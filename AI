Problem Statement: 

You will be shared an Excel File with Structured Command Data from a certain platform. You need to create a conversational interface that uses data from the file to answer user questions and generate Test Scripts. 

 

Functional Requirements: 

User should be able to interact with the Chatbot via a Web Interface. 

Chatbot should provide responses using context from the Excel Sheet wherever applicable.  

Chat conversations should have memory (previous user messages should be used in context for subsequent responses). 

Chatbot should mainly cover 3 scenarios -  
i. Command Suggestions for specific use cases (“What command should I use to do …”) 
ii. Complete Script generation (“Generate a test script to do ….”) 
iii. QA over command syntax/semantics (“What parameters to put for … command”, etc) 
 
Scenarios outside of these, or irrelevant questions should be handled with an error. 

(Bonus): 

Use Agentic AI-based implementation. Create a central chat agent with individual tools for context retrieval and response generation. 

Take input in the form of a Test Case  
(for example:  
1. User should click on Maps 
2. User should click on Search 
3. User should perform scroll 
…) and generate a Test Script with appropriate commands and parameters for all the Test Steps. 

 

Technical Requirements: 

Use Llama-3 using KGPT API as the LLM.  

Use nomic-embed-text hosted on KGPT as the Embeddings model. 

Use FAISS for the VectorDB. 

Use Streamlit for the Web Interface.
